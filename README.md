# NeuralNetwork-Java
This is a Java implementation of a basic neural network to read handwritten numbers from the MNIST data set. The training and test data are stored in a zip file under data/data.zip as .csv files for easy reading. In actually running the program, will need to extract data files from the zip archive and keep them in data/.

Outside of Java's standard libraries, I entirely coded all necessary functions myself, including matrix multiplication routines which are all kept in the same class as the NeuralNetwork class ( Although this should probably be stored in another file/class for better organization and future use ).

The network uses random values as a starting point and is trained iteratively against them. This means that you can train the network multiple times and get different overall accuracy as a result after going through the data. I have saved an iteration where ~91% accuracy was achieved, by having the program copy down import array values into a text file ( These are net1.txt and net1-Save1.txt ). 

The main file that does most of the work is NeuralNet.java, most other files are accessed by it and the entire program runs from NeuralNetDriver. This project uses various extra classes that I have made for reading the data, creating images from data and network output, and for saving a network's values for later use, all of which are again used by NeuralNet.java and partly by NeuralNetDriver.java. This project still lacks proper comments and appears to have unnecessary files ( files that I think are unused ) in it, so one day this will require some cleaning up to be more 'foreigner-friendly'.
