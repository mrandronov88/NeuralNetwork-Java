# NeuralNetwork-Java
This is a Java implementation of a basic neural network to read handwritten numbers from the MNIST data set. The training and test data are stored in a zip file under data/data.zip as .csv files for easy reading. In actually running the program, will need to extract data files from the zip archive and keep them in data/. Outside of Java's standard libraries, I entirely coded all necessary functions myself, including matrix multiplication routines which are all kept in the same class as the NeuralNetwork class ( Although this should probably be stored in another file/class for better organization and future use ).
